# The Backend For A Multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is a Go backend server that uses WebSockets to facilitate real-time
multiplayer games of Rock Paper Scissors. It handles player connections,
game state management, and communication between players.

## Copilot Instructions

-   Assume that the user is not familiar with Go, WebSockets, or real-time multiplayer game development.
-   Break down complex concepts into simple, easy-to-understand explanations.
-   Provide code snippets that are concise and focused on specific tasks or concepts.
-   Try to avoid large blocks of code; instead, break them into smaller, manageable pieces with explanations.
